    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS determines how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="point3">Css is not necessary</span><font size="+1"><span class="highlight">
            CSS saves a lot of work.</span></font> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="point4">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <span class="points">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
            <font size="+1"><span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,

            </span></font> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
        </span>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand,
         applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>in CSS, selectors are used to traget a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been  targeted,
         a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are Class and ID.
         Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
